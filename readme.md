# d

I wanted to carve out a spot to continue to learn Rust. `d` is a CLI app for David Harting. As I come across problems that I wished were solved differently, I'll implement a solution here. 

### Implementation

This is a CLI tool built in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) using [Clap](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap).

### What does the name mean?

It is `d` as in `D`avid. As in this app has one intended user named David Harting.
